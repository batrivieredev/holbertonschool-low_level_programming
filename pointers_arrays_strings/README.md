# **1ST PROJECT :**

## Resources
Read or watch:

- C - Arrays
- C - Pointers
- C - Strings
- Memory Layout

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

## Requirements
###  General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do, we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file

## More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, `malloc` and `free` - yet.

#  **3RDE PROJECT :**

# Resources
Read or watch:

- [C - Pointer to Pointer](#)
- [C – Pointer to Pointer with example](#)
- [Multi-dimensional Arrays in C](#)
- [Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example](#)

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without using Google:

## General
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

# Requirements

## General
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **File endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **README**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should follow the Betty style, checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global variables**: Not allowed
- **Functions per file**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library**: Usage of the standard library is not allowed (functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., are forbidden)
- **_putchar**: You are allowed to use `_putchar`
    - You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`; it won’t be taken into account if you do
- **Examples**: The provided `main.c` files are for testing functions. You don’t need to push them to your repo; they won’t be taken into account. We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation, which may differ from the examples shown.
- **Function Prototypes**: All function prototypes and `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `main.h`
- **Pushing files**: Don’t forget to push your header file

# More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, `malloc`, and `free` - yet.
