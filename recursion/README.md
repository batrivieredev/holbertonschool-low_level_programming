# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without using Google:

## General
- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion

# Requirements

## General
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **File endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **README**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should follow the Betty style, checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global variables**: Not allowed
- **Functions per file**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library**: Usage of the standard library is not allowed (functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., are forbidden)
- **_putchar**: You are allowed to use `_putchar`
    - You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`; it won’t be taken into account if you do
- **Examples**: The provided `main.c` files are for testing functions. You don’t need to push them to your repo; they won’t be taken into account. We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation, which may differ from the examples shown.
- **Function Prototypes**: All function prototypes and `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `main.h`
- **Pushing files**: Don’t forget to push your header file
- **Loops**: You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
- **Static variables**: You are not allowed to use static variables
