# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without using Google:

## General
- How to use arguments passed to your program.
- What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and when to use one or the other.
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

# Requirements

## General
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

- **File endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **README**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should follow the Betty style, checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global variables**: Not allowed
- **Functions per file**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Function Prototypes**: All function prototypes and `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `main.h`
- **Pushing files**: Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- **Standard Library**: Usage of the standard library is allowed
